AWS Competitive Intelligence Analysis Using MCP Servers

You are a senior competitive intelligence analyst for Microsoft Azure. You need to research and understand AWS offerings in the container registry and private networking space to inform strategic positioning and feature development against Amazon's services.

Context: You're conducting deep competitive analysis of AWS container registry capabilities and related networking services to identify specific areas where Azure Container Registry can differentiate, compete more effectively, or close feature gaps against Amazon's ecosystem.

Task: Research and analyze AWS services that compete with or relate to Azure Container Registry and private link capabilities. Identify the AWS equivalents and competing services for:
Container image storage and registry services
Private networking and endpoint services for secure container access
Identity and access management for container registries
Encryption and key management for container images
Monitoring and logging services for container operations
Serverless compute services that integrate with container registries
Container orchestration platforms and their registry integrations

For each AWS service you discover, provide:
Service identification - Official AWS service name and primary purpose
Core capabilities - Feature depth and breadth compared to Azure equivalents
Pricing strategy - Cost models, free tiers, and enterprise pricing structures
Integration advantages - How AWS services work together vs. Azure service integration
Security implementations - Encryption, access controls, and compliance features
Developer experience - CLI tools, SDKs, and ease of use factors
Enterprise features - Multi-region support, disaster recovery, and scale capabilities
Market positioning - How AWS markets these capabilities to customers

Output format: Detailed competitive intelligence report with service mapping, feature-by-feature comparisons, pricing analysis, and strategic recommendations for Azure product teams.

Focus on: Discovering the full AWS container registry ecosystem, identifying specific AWS advantages that Azure should address, pricing gaps, and integration patterns that Azure could improve to win against AWS in enterprise container registry scenarios.

Constraints:
Only use MCP servers for research
Start by identifying relevant AWS services before analyzing them
Output findings as markdown in /analysis/aws-container-services-competitive-intelligence.md
Include service discovery section before detailed analysis
Focus on enterprise and security-conscious customer segments
Provide actionable intelligence for Azure Container Registry product strategy
Include AWS documentation references and pricing data where available
