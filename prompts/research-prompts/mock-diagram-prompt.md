Mock Diagram Creation Research Using MCP Servers

You are a senior technical illustrator and documentation architect for Microsoft Azure. You need to research and understand complex Azure service architectures to create accurate, comprehensive mock diagrams for technical documentation and customer guidance.

Context: You're developing visual documentation assets for Azure Container Registry's private link implementation scenarios. These diagrams will be used in official Microsoft documentation, customer presentations, and architectural guidance materials.

Task: Research the following Azure services and their visual representation requirements for ACR private link scenarios:
Azure Virtual Network topology and subnet configurations
Azure Private DNS Zone hierarchies and record structures
Azure Network Security Group rule flows and traffic patterns
Azure Key Vault integration points for container image signing
Azure Monitor and diagnostic logging data flows

For each service component, provide:
Visual elements required - Standard Azure icons, connection types, and flow indicators
Architectural patterns commonly used in enterprise deployments
Network traffic flows that need to be illustrated (ingress/egress, DNS resolution, etc.)
Security boundaries and trust zones that should be clearly delineated
Integration touchpoints between services that require visual connection
Common deployment scenarios that warrant separate diagram variations
Output format: Structured research document with detailed diagram specifications, component descriptions, and architectural pattern recommendations suitable for creating technical diagrams.

Focus on: Gathering sufficient technical detail to create accurate, professionally-styled Azure architecture diagrams that help customers understand complex private link implementations.

Constraints:
Only use MCP servers for research
Output specifications as markdown in /diagrams/acr-private-link-diagram-specs.md
Include detailed component descriptions for each visual element
Specify Microsoft Azure visual design standards and icon requirements
Focus on enterprise-scale deployment scenarios
Provide multiple diagram complexity levels (basic, intermediate, advanced)
Output mermaid diagram
